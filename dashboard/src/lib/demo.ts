## Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-tenant SaaS platform** supporting 50+ concurrent tenants
2. **User authentication** via Cognito with role-based access control
3. **REST API** for all CRUD operations with OpenAPI spec
4. **Real-time notifications** via WebSocket for status updates
5. **Document storage** in S3 with tenant isolation

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Latency**: API responses < 200ms p95
- **Security**: SOC 2 Type II compliance
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale to 10k requests/minute

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints documented and tested
- Load test passes at 2x expected traffic
- Security scan shows zero critical/high findings
`,
  "docs/interviews.md": `# Stakeholder Interviews

## Interview 1: VP of Engineering
- Primary concern: **operational overhead** — wants serverless where possible
- Must integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Budget: $5k/month for infrastructure in first year

## Interview 2: Product Manager
- Priority: fast iteration on features
- Needs real-time dashboard for monitoring engagement progress
- Wants approval gates before each phase transition

## Interview 3: Security Lead
- Requires tenant data isolation at all layers
- Encryption at rest and in transit mandatory
- Audit logging for all data access
`,
  "docs/architecture.md": `# System Architecture

## Overview

Serverless-first architecture using AWS managed services to minimize operational overhead.

## Components

### API Layer
- **API Gateway** (REST) with Lambda integrations
- Request validation and rate limiting at gateway level
- Cognito authorizer for JWT-based authentication

### Compute
- **Lambda** for synchronous API handlers (< 30s)
- **ECS Fargate** for long-running agent swarms (up to 1 hour)
- **Step Functions** for phase orchestration with approval gates

### Data
- **DynamoDB** single-table design for operational data
- **S3** for document storage and artifact persistence
- **Bedrock Knowledge Base** for semantic search across project artifacts

### Real-Time
- **API Gateway WebSocket** for live dashboard updates
- Connection management via DynamoDB with TTL cleanup

## Architecture Decision Records
- ADR-001: Serverless over containers for API layer
- ADR-002: Cognito for authentication (vs custom auth)
`,
  "docs/data-model.md": `# Data Model

## DynamoDB Single-Table Design

### Access Patterns

| Pattern | PK | SK |
|---------|----|----|
| Get project | PROJECT#{id} | METADATA |
| List tasks | PROJECT#{id} | TASK#{phase}#{id} |
| Get activity | PROJECT#{id} | EVENT#{timestamp} |

### Global Secondary Indexes

1. **GSI1**: Phase lookup — PK: PHASE#{name}, SK: PROJECT#{id}
2. **GSI2**: Agent lookup — PK: AGENT#{name}, SK: TASK#{id}
3. **GSI3**: Status lookup — PK: STATUS#{status}, SK: timestamp
`,
  "poc/auth-poc.md": `# Auth Proof-of-Concept

## Cognito Configuration
- User Pool: \`ecommerce-migration-poc\`
- App Client: SPA with PKCE flow (no client secret)
- Custom attributes: \`tenant_id\`, \`role\`

## Implemented Flows
1. **Sign Up** — email verification with custom message template
2. **Sign In** — returns JWT with tenant context in custom claims
3. **Token Refresh** — silent refresh via iframe (SPA pattern)
4. **Password Reset** — verification code via SES

## Integration Points
- API Gateway Cognito Authorizer validates JWT on every request
- Lambda extracts \`tenant_id\` from token claims for row-level filtering
- CloudFront signed cookies for S3 asset access

## Test Results
- Sign-up to first API call: **1.2 seconds** (target: < 3s)
- Token refresh latency: **89ms** p95
- Concurrent auth flows tested: **500 simultaneous**
`,
  "poc/load-test-results.md": `# Load Test Results

## Test Configuration
- **Tool**: Artillery.io with custom scenarios
- **Duration**: 10 minutes sustained + 2 minute spike
- **Target**: 2x expected peak (20,000 req/min)
- **Regions**: us-east-1, eu-west-1

## Results Summary

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| p50 latency | < 100ms | 67ms | PASS |
| p95 latency | < 200ms | 142ms | PASS |
| p99 latency | < 500ms | 289ms | PASS |
| Error rate | < 0.1% | 0.02% | PASS |
| Throughput | 20k/min | 23.4k/min | PASS |

## Cold Start Analysis
- Lambda cold starts: 847ms average (provisioned concurrency applied)
- After provisioned concurrency: 12ms average
- Recommendation: Keep 10 provisioned instances for production

## Bottlenecks Identified
1. DynamoDB consumed capacity spikes during burst — switched to on-demand
2. API Gateway throttling at 10k/s default — requested limit increase
`,
  "poc/migration-runbook.md": `# Migration Runbook (Draft)

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Database snapshot taken and verified
- [ ] Blue-green deployment tested in staging
- [ ] Rollback procedure validated
- [ ] Customer notification sent (T-48 hours)
- [ ] On-call roster confirmed

## Migration Steps
1. Enable DynamoDB Streams on source table
2. Run initial bulk data load (estimated: 4 hours)
3. Activate CDC replication via Lambda
4. Verify data consistency (checksums)
5. Switch DNS to new API Gateway endpoint
6. Monitor for 30 minutes
7. Disable legacy API endpoints

## Rollback Procedure
- **Trigger**: Error rate > 1% or p95 > 500ms for 5 minutes
- **Action**: Revert DNS to legacy endpoints (TTL: 60s)
- **Recovery**: All writes during migration window captured in DynamoDB Streams
`,
  "production/deployment-guide.md": `# Production Deployment Guide

## Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

### Architecture
- **Blue**: Current production (legacy EC2 + RDS)
- **Green**: New architecture (Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway)
- **Router**: Route 53 weighted routing for gradual traffic shift

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy green environment via Terraform
2. Run smoke tests against green (automated)
3. Shift 5% traffic to green, monitor for 15 minutes
4. Shift 25% → 50% → 100% (15-minute intervals)
5. Decommission blue after 48-hour bake period

### Rollback Triggers (Automatic)
- Error rate exceeds 0.5% over 5-minute window
- p95 latency exceeds 400ms over 5-minute window
- Any 5xx errors from health check endpoints

### CodeDeploy Configuration
\`\`\`yaml
deployment:
  type: BLUE_GREEN
  traffic_routing:
    type: TimeBasedLinear
    interval: 15
    percentage: 25
  alarms:
    - HighErrorRate
    - HighLatency
    - HealthCheckFailed
\`\`\`
`,
  "production/monitoring.md": `# Monitoring & Alerting Configuration

## CloudWatch Dashboards

### API Health Dashboard
- Request count (1-minute granularity)
- Error rate by endpoint
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Lambda concurrent executions
- DynamoDB consumed capacity

### Infrastructure Dashboard
- VPC flow logs summary
- NAT Gateway throughput
- S3 request metrics
- CloudFront cache hit ratio

## Alarm Configuration

| Alarm | Threshold | Period | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| High Error Rate | > 1% | 5 min | PagerDuty P1 |
| High Latency | p95 > 300ms | 5 min | PagerDuty P2 |
| DynamoDB Throttling | > 0 | 1 min | Slack + Auto-scale |
| Lambda Errors | > 10/min | 5 min | PagerDuty P2 |
| Budget Alert | > 80% forecast | Daily | Email to stakeholders |

## Log Aggregation
- All Lambda logs → CloudWatch Log Groups
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs

  "production/migration-report.md": `# Data Migration Report

## Summary
- **Tables migrated**: 47 of 47 (100%)
- **Records migrated**: 2,847,329
- **Duration**: 3 hours 42 minutes
- **Data loss**: 0 records
- **Schema mismatches resolved**: 12 (see details below)

## Schema Adaptations
| Table | Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| orders | DATE column nulls | Default to epoch, flagged for review |
| products | VARCHAR(MAX) fields | Truncated to 400KB DynamoDB limit |
| users | Duplicate emails | Merged by most recent login timestamp |

## Validation Results
- Checksum verification: PASS (all 47 tables)
- Record count verification: PASS
- Sample query validation: 50 random queries, all returned identical results
- Referential integrity: PASS (all foreign key relationships preserved as GSI lookups)

## Performance Impact
- Source database load during migration: < 15% CPU increase
- Zero downtime — CDC replication maintained consistency

## Incident Response

### P1 — Service Down
1. Check CloudWatch API Health dashboard
2. Verify Lambda function health: \`aws lambda get-function --function-name api-handler\`
3. Check DynamoDB table status and throttling metrics
4. If Lambda errors: check recent deployment, rollback if needed
5. If DynamoDB throttling: verify on-demand scaling is active
6. Escalation: page Solutions Architect if not resolved in 15 minutes

### P2 — Degraded Performance
1. Check latency dashboard for affected endpoints
2. Review Lambda cold start metrics
3. Verify provisioned concurrency allocation
4. Check downstream service health (Cognito, S3)

## Scaling Procedures
- **Lambda**: Auto-scales. Monitor concurrent execution limit (1000 default)
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand mode, no action needed for normal scaling
- **API Gateway**: Request throttle increase via AWS Support if approaching 10k/s

## Routine Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Review CloudWatch cost anomaly report
- **Monthly**: Rotate Cognito signing keys, review IAM access reports
- **Quarterly**: Run penetration test, update dependency versions
